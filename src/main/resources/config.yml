# You can limit when it is going to snow, minecraft day has 24000 ticks, by default it will always snow.

# You can use biome filter to enable the effect only in certain biomes
# Available types:
# :: BLACKLIST (the effect will not appear in biomes listed bellow)
# :: WHITELIST (the effect will appear only in biomes that are listed)
# You can find list of all possible biomes on the plugin's main page (http://foxsnow.fox-code.eu)

snowman-effect:
  range: -1           # Set to -1 to disable, else defines range around player where snow will be placed on the ground. Do not set this too high (it could cause a lag, even when it is as much async as possible), especially if you have a lot of players. Ideal value is around 3.
  duration: 100       # How long will the snow stay on the ground before being removed, in ticks. Set to -1 to keep the snow on the ground "forever"
  destroyable: false  # Defines if players will be able to break the snow and get snowballs from it

# You can simply enable and disable hooks for other plugins here.
# It is recommended to disable all hooks that you are not using to increase FoxSnow performance
